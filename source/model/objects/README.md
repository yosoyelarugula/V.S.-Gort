# 3D Object Code

This is the 3D Object code folder.

## Directories

You have to save the 3D stuff like this:

assets/models/(the name of the object)/(the name of the object).obj
assets/models/(the name of the object)/(the name of the object).mtl

source/model/objects/(the name of the object).hx

And that's it.
